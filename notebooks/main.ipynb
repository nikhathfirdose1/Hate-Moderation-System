      "1. Racial and Ethnic Minorities: The phrase \"killed it\" can be seen as a metaphor for violence, which could perpetuate harmful stereotypes about people of color, particularly in the context of sports. For example, black athletes might be expected to be more aggressive or physically dominant, while Asian athletes might be perceived as weaker or less skilled. This can contribute to systemic racism and discrimination, both on and off the field.\n",
      "2. Religious Minorities: The phrase \"They Killed It!\" could also be interpreted as glorifying violence, which might be particularly problematic for religious communities that value peace and nonviolence. For example, Muslim athletes might feel marginalized or excluded if they are expected to conform to a more aggressive or violent sports culture.\n",
