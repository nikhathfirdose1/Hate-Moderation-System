bavb8x-post	I ordered too much food for myself and decided against eating it all by my fat self by giving it to an old man. It was at an area in the central business district where I'd seen a few homeless men that have been sleeping at this bridge on previous occasions. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I struggled for really long before giving it, i imagined people looking at me weirdly and myself feeling awkward and shy about doing it for the first time over what would happen. (Too much happy/emotional Facebook vids of people doing good deeds) [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] It took me a good hour to actually to do it, and when I did he seemed abit confused as he was trying to sleep but kept tossing and turning. I just mumbled 'here's something for you to eat.' [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nothing much happened but I stayed behind for a while and saw him opening up the packet of food, not sure if he ate it or not. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I don't feel especially happy or good, just really normal. It's my first time doing it and not something I'd normally do, but I sincerely hope it can help him get through for the few hours and make his night.	False

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Paying a gaming company money so that I can ""work"" at a leisure activity ""to be good at it"" is hillarious to a working man. It's kids duplicating their experience with school and homework in their spare time because that's all they know.

bfgsmg-post	Reddit fucking sucks a big fake fucking ass. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] The community has hit a fucking disgusting new low of fakeness and inoffensiveness it's disgusting.

That's all. You fucking Infantiles. AND WHY ON r/blackmagicfuckery?????????? If you fucking retards don't care WHAT FUCKING CONTENT IS POSTED AND WHERE IT'S POSTED THEN WHY NOT JUST POST A BUNCH OF BLANK PICTURES. The fucking comments are always full of these fake fucking hipsters who just fucking hate what's trending to hate and love whatever inoffensive shit they're spoonfed I fucking can't deal with it. Reddit has become a fucking dystopia where all the people are just copies of cunts who sit at coffee shops with their laptops every morning from 8-10. Meanwhile, you have this one fucking retard in the controversial denying the fucking holocaust like some fucking tinfoil wearing piece of shit. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] The fucking straw that broke the camel's back was the fact that r/waterniggas just got fucking quarantined for being offensive. This is a perfect example of taking shit out of context. THE FUCKING SUB IS JUST MEMES ABOUT WATER YOU SNOWFLAKE FUCKING TUMBLR REFUGEES. IF NO ONE'S COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING THEN DON'T FUCKING ACT LIKE YOU'RE A BUNCH OF MARTIN LUTHER KINGS PURIFYING REDDIT OF ITS OFFENSIVE HATE SUBS!

Very little room for engagement. I tried to see things their way and gain a different perspective. Went to the churches. Shot the guns. Listened to their pundits. I never felt welcomed or challenged to change my view. I only ever encountered entrenched hostility from these folks. And the sad thing is that a lot of the ideology isn't even what we're up against. For some of the older folks sure, but the younger people seem to have this need for attention and engagement that isn't even political, or for the sake of displaying their platform.  It's not for me.

ephaclp	Uhh, I watched the whole fucking thing and remember it very well. And always will. Feel free to remind yourself by revisiting the ample coverage that is freely available.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Republicans fretted and worried and were very much deeply concerned about the 'timing' of Ford's accusations. Because they were worried that Dems and softy liberals would be all feels over reels when she testified. Then, when she gave sober, calm, methodical, thoughtful and credible testimony they flipped the script and cloaked the nomination the sanctity of that POOR MAN and his anger.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] So they overlooked his lying, the inconsistencies in his statements and made up some bullshit about why they couldn't investigate Blasey's claims by interviewing that poor man's friend because of his feelings.

epjc95a	>Imagine watching the legitimately elected president be hamstrung left and right by government officials both elected and unelecte [linebreak]  [linebreak] Trump is not hamstrung.  Inconvenienced and hampered?  Sure, just like every other president.  The only thing Trump has had to deal with that others haven't is an incredibly hostile media (arguably something Trump himself intentionally caused) and Mueller (arguably something that's done far more harm than good to the DNC's agenda.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] Even so, he's been accomplishing a shitload.  The issues the Media can't shut up about are the red cloth he waves in front of them while he gets shit done behind the scenes - see the SCOTUS and the many, many judges he's appointed. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] >spurred on by a complicit media complex that has roughly half of the country believing their every word, [linebreak]  [linebreak] Reddit is not reality.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] What do you think is going to happen?  Do you think the 1-3% of the actual American populace represented by r/politics and places on Reddit like it are going to cause some kind of massive uprising or civil war?  They're not.  They aren't going to do anything but continue to shitpost on Reddit. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Anyone who thinks that what we have today is anywhere near bad enough to bring us to a civil war seriously needs to get off Reddit and disconnect from politics for a while.

ep0dp73	I've always tried to explain their behaviour or talk them down off the ledge but the push back is very telling. They want to hate. Pure and simple. And there is a lot of antisocial and asocial behavior in the mix as well. They way they talk to one another is atrocious as well. And it's all just for lolz, praising Elliot Rodgers, the racial bigotry, the insistence on women bileing nothing more than broodmares and sex dispensers, we're all supposed to take it as humor. I'm not laughing. There was a default sub dedicated to beating women for a long time, that should tell you what you need to know about reddit and its userbase.	True

es3xijn	"-Corporate Power Solidfied: Bans. They don't have to allow any criticisms or differing opinions. Some of the biggest corporations that pull in hundreds of billions are literally controlling what you get to say and do online. And there's no situation where a corporation can be taken down by the law. CEO's for instance, will be caught purposefully suppressing certain points of view, they could ban all Republicans let's say. And not only will they not face consequences because ""they're a private company they can do what they want"", and ""the first amendment doesn't apply to corporations"", but that CEO will also be able to keep his job. Those who were banned? If they try to speak out, they'll be sued into poverty and be painted a liar and be under attack on social networking and maybe even in-person, and they'll have had to expose all of that trauma to the entirety of the American public, their family, their friends, etc. All for nothing. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Individual choice Suppressed: What choices do people even have any more? This is a vicious socialist system that doesn't give a fuck about the working class. They don't even want to give us a voice. There's NO wage gap at all. You're treated like you're their bitch. But you're eternally accused of being misogynist or having internalized misogyny so you can't afford to fight back and keep your dignity by challenging them. And what can you do about it? Start a YouTube channel? You'll be banned so quickly for going against the narrative, your head will spin. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Disdain For Intellectuals & STEM: They literally call science ""white supremacy."" That is TEXTBOOK fascism for fuck's sake... They hate facts, logic, reason, science, etc. Because a society run by those things would mean these demagogues and progressives would lose their power and control, and things would be forced to become more balanced and efficient, which would hurt the trust fund kids starting this fascist movement in the first place... [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] And fascists laugh at anybody who majors in STEM. They hate any new science study that goes against the narrative, and fascists throughout history politicize EVERYTHING, including science. They hate strong female leads in film now, black people or Mexican or gay people writing Young Adult novels or even TOO MANY of them in the cast in general because then it will be ""fetishizing"". They want it acceptable by their weird-ass standards or it's ""white supremacy."" Which is very bad when you consider: They think all forms of free expression are political... This implies that they feel they should have power to dictate if a study's political implication fits into their agenda, and if it doesn't, it should not be allowed to be published. (Luckily they're failing miserably at this... For now.) Them shutting down certain types of studies would have drastic consequences. And we need to look out for that. What if biology, chemistry, physics, and neurobiology, for instance would have gotten shut down the way radical left-wingers wanted it to be? Those are very important fields of studythat have done an amazing amount of good for our evolution as a species. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Obsession With Hate Crimes & Abandoning due process: Oh, man... The VICIOUS voyeurism and love of witnessing suffering here is insane. Our media is trying to desensitize us to it, while at the same time make us view it as ""honorable,"" and/or ""necessary."" To actually encourage us to be entertained by it. They insist that: [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] ""It's immoral, and that that person is totally a victim of a system that led them down this horrible life path that resulted in them becoming a criminal.  They're just an oppressed individual who should have no accountability, and had no choice but to break the law. No, I can't prove that the system is oppressive... Or back up any of my other claims... And there are effective ways at reducing crime that don't abandon due process... But NO! I'm a fascist, and I don't believe that there's such thing as innocent until proven guilty! We're all problematic, and stuff! ESPECIALLY WHITE PEOPLE! White males, and Christians, and Jewish babies, and stuff! WHITE PEOPLE ARE ALL RACISTS! *Cultural Marxist chant ""We will not be silenced by your violence"" over and over again while fantasizing they're overthrowing the government and evil white men* [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] To them, this man is a saint who decided to fake a hate crime because he wanted to start a conversation... He thought that since he couldn't actually be a victim of a hate crime, he'd make one up so he could gain all the sympathy he garnered as if one actually existed. And maybe get an extension on his contract at his lucrative Fox show... But nope. Fascists don't like accountability one bit. Hence why he was allowed to get off scott free... Because abandoning due process = LESS accountability for those on their side."	True
ek8b2nt	Fast travel doesn't make a game easier... [linebreak]  [linebreak] And I have no recollection of any significant number of people criticising the game at launch of having fast travel.
